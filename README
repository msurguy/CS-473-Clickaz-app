This application simulates the operation of Clickers used in schools and colleges to get immediate response and feedback from users. 
It is similar to an online survey where each question has 4 choices and the user has to make one choice submit it.

== Using Clickaz Web App

To use the app the user has to go to application's root.
The user will be presented with a list of questions. Then the user has to click on 'Respond' to respond to specific question.
On the next screen, the user will choose the answer to the question and identify himself by checking appropriate radio button. 
After the choice is made, the user will save the response by clicking on "Update response" button.

To view the global results of the polling, the user may click on "Show Results".

== Application URL structure 

root - presents the list of questions
root/questions/list  - same as root
root/responses/list - presents the results of polling

== Management

/questions       -   to add/edit/delete the questions for the survey
/responses 	  -   to add/edit/delete specific user responses (this is not the same as polling!)
/answers		  -   to add/edit/delete the answers for each question
/users	          -  to add/edit/delete the users (by default 9 users are created)
